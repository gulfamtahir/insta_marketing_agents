## Introduction
Managing an Instagram account can be overwhelming — especially for influencers and solo creators. After speaking with a friend who was spending too much time (and money) managing her Instagram marketing team, I built a solution:

Insta Marketing Agent is a fully autonomous system that streamlines and automates Instagram content planning. All it needs is your account description and a weekly content topic. From there, it delivers an entire strategy – ready to go.

## Features
- **Hashtag Research**: Intelligent, trend-based hashtag suggestions for maximum reach.
- **Competitor Analysis**:  Insights based on similar niche profiles to optimize your strategy.
- **SEO-Optimized Captions**: Tailored captions that are engaging and searchable
- **Trend-Based Scheduling**: Offers resume tips tailored to your target job domain.

2. Install dependencies:
